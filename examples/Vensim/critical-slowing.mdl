:MACRO: PINK NOISE(mean, std deviation, correlation time, seed)
PINK NOISE = INTEG(updating pink noise,mean+std deviation*RANDOM NORMAL(-6,6,0,1,seed))
	~	mean
	~	Contributed by Ed Anderson, MIT/U. Texas - Austin
		Description:  The pink noise molecule described generates a simple random 
		series with autocorrelation.  This is useful in representing time series, 
		like rainfall from day to day, in which today's value has some correlation 
		with what happened yesterday.  This particular formulation will also have 
		properties such as standard deviation and mean that are insensitive both to 
		the time step and the correlation (smoothing) time.  Finally, the output as 
		a whole and the difference in values between any two days is guaranteed to 
		be Gaussian (normal) in distribution.
		
		Behavior:  Pink noise series will have both a historical and a random 
		component during each period.  The relative "trend-to-noise" ratio is 
		controlled by the length of the correlation time. As the correlation time 
		approaches zero, the pink noise output will become more independent of its 
		historical value and more "noisy."  On the other hand, as the correlation 
		time approaches infinity, the pink noise output will approximate a 
		continuous time random walk or Brownian motion.  Displayed above are two 
		time series with correlation times of 1 and 8 months.  While both series 
		have approximately the same standard deviation, the 1-month correlation time 
		series is less smooth from period to period than the 8-month series, which 
		is characterized by "sustained" swings in a given direction.  Note that this 
		behavior will be independent of the time-step.
		
		The "pink" in pink noise refers to the power spectrum of the output.  A time 
		series in which each period's observation is independent of the past is 
		characterized by a flat or "white" power spectrum.  Smoothing a time series 
		attenuates the higher or "bluer" frequencies of the power spectrum, leaving 
		the lower or "redder" frequencies relatively stronger in the output.
		
		Caveats:  This assumes the use of Euler integration with a time step of no 
		more than 1/4 of the correlation time.  Very long correlation times should be 
		avoided also as the multiplication in the scaled white noise will become 
		progressively less accurate.
		
		Technical Notes:  This particular form of pink noise is superior to that of 
		Britting presented in Richardson and Pugh (1981) because the Gaussian 
		(Normal) distribution of the output does not depend on the Central Limit 
		Theorem.  (Dynamo did not have a Gaussian random number generator and hence 
		R&P had to invoke the CLM to get a normal distribution.)  Rather, this 
		molecule's normal output is a result of the observations being a sum of 
		Gaussian draws.  Hence, the series over short intervals should better 
		approximate normality than the macro in R&P. 
		
		MEAN: This is the desired mean for the pink noise.
		STD DEVIATION: This is the desired standard deviation for the pink noise.
		CORRELATION TIME: This is the smooth time for the noise, or for the more technically \
		minded this is the inverse of the filter's cut-off frequency in radians.
		
		Updated by Tom Fiddaman, 2010, to include a random initial value,
		correct units, and use TIME STEP$ keyword

scaled white noise =mean+white noise*std deviation*SQRT((2-time step$/correlation time
)/(time step$/correlation time))
	~	mean
	~	This adjusts the standard deviation of the white noise to compensate for the time \
		step and the
		         correlation time to produce the appropriate pink noise std \
		deviation.

white noise = RANDOM NORMAL(-6,6,0,1,seed)
	~	dmnl
	~	This is an independent, identically distributed random quantity drawn every time \
		step.  The distribution is gaussian with mean = 0 and variance = 1.
		Note that RANDOM NORMAL is truncated +/- 6 standard deviations here.
		For Vensim 1.62 syntax, remove the arguments to RANDOM NORMAL.
