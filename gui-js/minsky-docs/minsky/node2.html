New to system dynamics?
</H1>

<P>
Minsky is one of a family of &ldquo;system dynamics&rdquo; computer
programs. These programs allow a dynamic model to be constructed, not
by writing mathematical equations or numerous lines of computer code,
but by laying out a model of a system in a block diagram, which can then
simulate the system. These programs are now the main tool used by
engineers to design complex products, ranging from small electrical
components right up to passenger jets.

<P>
Minsky adds another means to create the dynamic equations that are
needed to define monetary flows--the &ldquo;Godley Table&rdquo;--which is
discussed in the next section for users who are experienced in
system dynamics. In this section, we'll give you a quick overview of
the generic system dynamics approach to building a model.

<P>
Though they differ in appearance, they all work the same way:
variables in a set of equations are linked by wires to mathematical
operators. What would otherwise be a long list of equations is
converted into a block diagram, and the block diagram makes the causal chain
in the equations explicit and visually obvious.

<P>
For example, say you wanted to define the rate of employment as
depending on output (GDP), labor productivity and population. Then you
could define a set of equations in a suitable program (like Mathcad):

<P>
<P></P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER" CLASS="mathdisplay">
<!-- MATH
 \begin{eqnarray*}
\mathrm{GDP}&:=&100\\
\mathrm{LaborProductivity}&:=&1\\
\mathrm{Population}&:=&100\\
\mathrm{Workers}&:=&\mathrm{GDP}\div\mathrm{LaborProductivity}\\
\mathrm{EmpRate}&:=&\mathrm{Workers}\div\mathrm{Population}\\
\mathrm{EmpRate}&=&1
\end{eqnarray*}
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="361" HEIGHT="147" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img26.png"
 ALT="\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathrm{GDP}&amp;:=&amp;100\\
\mathrm{LaborProductivity}&amp;:=&amp;1\\
\mat...
...&amp;\mathrm{Workers}\div\mathrm{Population}\\
\mathrm{EmpRate}&amp;=&amp;1
\end{eqnarray*}"></DIV>
<BR CLEAR="ALL"><P></P>
<BR CLEAR="ALL"><P></P>

<P>
Or you could define it using a block diagram, such as Minsky:

<P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<!-- MATH
 $\resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{\includegraphics{images/NewItem1.eps}}$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="555" HEIGHT="168" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img27.png"
 ALT="\resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{\includegraphics{images/NewItem1.eps}}">
</DIV>

<P>
For a simple algebraic equation like this, modern computer algebra
programs like Mathcad are just as good as a block diagram programs like
Vissim or Minsky. But the visual metaphor excels when you want to describe a
complex causal chain.

<P>
These causal chains always involve a relationship between stocks and
flows. Economists normally model stocks and flows by adding an
increment to a stock. For example, the level of capital <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img28.png"
 ALT="$K$"></SPAN> is defined as
a difference equation, where capital in year <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img11.png"
 ALT="$t$"></SPAN> is shown as being 
capital in year <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="37" HEIGHT="29" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img29.png"
 ALT="$t-1$"></SPAN> plus the investment that took place that year:

<P>
<BR><P></P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER" CLASS="mathdisplay">
<!-- MATH
 \begin{displaymath}
K_t=K_{t-1}+I_{t-1}
\end{displaymath}
 -->

<IMG
 WIDTH="123" HEIGHT="28" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img30.png"
 ALT="\begin{displaymath}
K_t=K_{t-1}+I_{t-1}
\end{displaymath}">
</DIV>
<BR CLEAR="ALL">
<P></P>

<P>
The problem with this approach is that in reality, capital is
accumulating on a daily, or even hourly, basis. It is better to model
stock as continuous quantities and for this reason, all stocks and
flows in Minsky are handled instead as integral equations. The amount
of capital at time <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img11.png"
 ALT="$t$"></SPAN> is shown as the integral of net investment
between time 0 and today:

<P>
<BR><P></P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER" CLASS="mathdisplay">
<!-- MATH
 \begin{displaymath}
K(t)=\int_0^t I(s)ds
\end{displaymath}
 -->

<IMG
 WIDTH="121" HEIGHT="46" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img31.png"
 ALT="\begin{displaymath}
K(t)=\int_0^t I(s)ds
\end{displaymath}">
</DIV>
<BR CLEAR="ALL">
<P></P>

<P>
However, rather than being shown as an equation, the relationship is shown as a diagram:

<P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<IMG
 WIDTH="155" HEIGHT="50" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img32.png"
 ALT="\includegraphics{images/NewItem7.eps}">

</DIV>

<P>
The advantages of the block diagram representation of dynamic equations
over a list of equations are:

<UL>
<LI>They make the causal relationships in a complex model
  obvious. It takes a specialized mind to be able to see the causal
  relations in a large set of mathematical equations; the same
  equations laid out as diagrams can be read by anyone who can read
  a stock and flow diagram--and that's most of us;
</LI>
<LI>The block diagram paradigm makes it possible to store components of
  a complex block diagram in a group. For example, the fuel delivery
  system in a car can be treated as one group, the engine as another,
  the exhaust as yet another. This reduces visual complexity and also
  makes it possible for different components of a complex model to be
  designed by different groups and then &ldquo;wired together&rdquo; at a later
  stage.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
For example, here's a model of a 4 cylinder engine car--one of the
simple examples distributed with the program Vissim:

<P>

</DIV>

<P>
Programs like Vissim and Simulink have been in existence for almost 2
decades, and they are now mature products that provide everything
their user-base of engineers want for modeling and analyzing complex
dynamic systems. <A HREF="node3.html#intro:experienced">So why has Minsky been
