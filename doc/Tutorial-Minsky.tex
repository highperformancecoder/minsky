\section{Basic System Dynamics model}

In 1965, Richard Goodwin, the great pioneer of complexity in economics,
presented the paper \htmladdnormallink{``A Growth Cycle''}{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodwinmodel(economics)}
to the First World Congress of the Econometric Society in Rome. It
was later published in a book collection (Goodwin, Richard M. 1967.
"A Growth Cycle," in C. H. Feinstein, {\em Socialism, Capitalism
and Economic Growth}. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp.
54--58.); to my knowledge it was never published in a journal.

Goodwin's model has been subjected to much critical literature about
implying stable cycles, not matching empirical data, etc., but Goodwin
himself emphasized that it was a ``starkly schematized and hence
quite unrealistic model of cycles in growth rates". He argued however
that it was a better foundation for a more realistic model than ``the
more usual treatment of growth theory or of cycle theory, separately
or in combination.''

Goodwin emphasized the similarity of this model to the Lokta-Volterra
model of interacting predator and prey, which can make it seem as
if it was derived by analogy to the biological model. But in fact
it can easily be derived from a highly simplified causal chain:
\begin{itemize}
\item The level of output ($Y$) determines the level of employment ($L$),
with $L=Y/a$ where $a$ is a measure of labor productivity; 
\item Given a population $N$, the employment rate $\lambda=L/N$ plays
a role in determining the \textbf{\em rate of change} of the wage
$w$: Goodwin used a linear approximation to a non-linear ``Phillips
Curve'':

%\fwhtmladdimg{NewItem55.png}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics{images/PhillipsCurve} 
\par\end{center}

His linear approximation was:

\[
\frac{1}{w}\frac{d}{dt}w=-\gamma+\rho\cdot\lambda
\]

\item In a simple two-class model, profits $\Pi$ equals the level of output
$Y$ minus the wage bill: $\Pi=Y-wL$ 
\item For simplicity, Goodwin assumed that all profits were invested, so
that Investment equals profits: $I=\Pi$. 
\item Investment is the rate of change of the capital stock $K$; 
\item The level of output is, to a first approximation, determined by the
level of capital stock ($K$). A simple way of stating this is that
$Y$ is proportional to $K$: $Y=K/v$, where $v$ is a constant (Goodwin
notes that this relation ``could be softened but it would mean a
serious complicating of the structure of the model''); and finally 
\item Goodwin assumed that labor productivity grew at a constant rate $\alpha$,
while population grew at a constant rate $\beta$.

Goodwin published the model as a reduced form equation in the two
system states the employment rate ($\lambda$) and the workers' share
of output ($\omega$):

\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{d}{dt}\lambda & = & \lambda\left(\frac{1-\omega}{v}-\alpha-\beta\right)\\
\frac{d}{dt}\omega & = & \omega\cdot\left(\rho\cdot\lambda-\gamma-\alpha\right)
\end{eqnarray*}

\end{itemize}
This form is useful for analytic reasons, but it obscures the causal
chain that actually lies behind the model. With modern system dynamic
software, this can be laid out explicitly, and we can also use much
more meaningful names. We'll start with defining output (which is
a variable). Click on \buttonIcon{var.eps} on the Icon Palette,
or click on the Operations menu and choose ``Variable''. This will
open up the ``Specify Variable Name'' window:
\begin{center}
\scalebox{0.5}{\htmladdimg{NewItem63.png}} 
\par\end{center}

Enter ``{\em\textbf{GDP}'' into the ``Name'' field, and leave
the other fields blank---since {\emGDP} is a variable and we're
defining a dynamic system, the value of {\emGDP} at any particular
point in time will depend on the other entities in the model. Now
Click OK (or press ``Enter''). The variable will now appear, attached
to the cursor. Move to a point near the top of the screen and click,
which will place the variable at that location.}

We are now going to write the first part of the model, that Labor
({\em\textbf{Labor}) equals output ({\emGDP}) divided by labor
productivity ({\emLabProd}). Just for the sake of illustration,
we'll make {\ema} a parameter, which is a named constant (this
can easily be modified later). For this we start by clicking on \buttonIcon{const.eps}
on the Palette, or by choosing Insert/variable from the menu. This
will pop-up the Edit Constant window:}
\begin{center}
\scalebox{0.5}{\htmladdimg{NewItem66.png}} 
\par\end{center}

There is actually no real difference between the ``Edit constant''
dialog and the ``Edit variable'' dialog. The window's title differs,
and the default value of Type is ``constant'' instead of ``flow''.
We're going to select ``parameter'', allowing one to give the parameter
a name.

Give the paramter the name ``{\em\textbf{LabProd}'' and the value
of 1 (i.e., one unit of output per worker). Click OK or press Enter
and the constant \buttonIcon{LabProd.eps} will now be attached to
the cursor. Place it below {\emGDP}:}
\begin{center}
\scalebox{0.5}{\htmladdimg{NewItem66.png}} 
\par\end{center}

Now we need to divide {\em\textbf{GDP} by {\emLabProd}. Click
on the \buttonIcon{divide.eps} symbol on the palette and the symbol
will be attached to the cursor. Drag it near the other two objects
and click. Your Canvas will now look something like this:}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{images/NewItem70} 
\par\end{center}

Now to complete the equation, you have to attach {\em\textbf{GDP}
to the top of the divide block and LabProd to the bottom.}

Now move your cursor to the right hand side of \buttonIcon{GDP.eps}
and click, hold the mouse button down, and drag. An arrow will come
out from \buttonIcon{GDP.eps}. Drag this arrow to the top of the
divide block (where you'll see a tiny multiply sign) and release the
mouse. You should then see this:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{images/NewItem74} 
\par\end{center}

When the mouse hovers over a block, you will then see little circles
that identify the input and output ports of the block:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{images/NewItem75} 
\par\end{center}

Those are the connection points for wires, so start dragging from
one and release on the other. Now wire LabProd to the bottom of the
Divide block (where you'll see a miniature divide symbol (blown up
below):
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{images/NewItem76} 
\par\end{center}

Then click on \buttonIcon{var.eps} in the Design Icons to create
a new variable, call it Labor, place it the the right of the Divide
block, and wire the output port from the Divide block to the input
port for \textbf{\em Labor}:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{images/NewItem79} 
\par\end{center}

To show the correspondence between the flowchart above and standard
modeling equations, click on the equations tab:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathrm{GDP} & =\\
\mathrm{Labor} & = & \frac{\mathrm{GDP}}{\mathrm{LabProd}}\\
\end{eqnarray*}

Now let's keep going with the model. With \textbf{\em Labor} defined,
the employment rate will be \textbf{\em Labor} divided by \textbf{\em
Population}. Define \textbf{\em Population} as a parameter (we'll
later change it to a variable), and give it a value of 110.
\begin{center}
\scalebox{0.5}{\htmladdimg{NewItem81.png}} 
\par\end{center}

Add it to the Canvas and you are now ready to define the employment
rate---another variable. Click on \buttonIcon{var.eps}, give it
the name ``$\backslash$lambda'' (be sure to include the backslash
symbol), put another Divide block on the canvas, choose Wire mode
and wire this next part of the model up. You should now have:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{images/NewItem83} 
\par\end{center}

Now switch to the equations tab, and you will see

\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathrm{GDP} & =\\
\mathrm{Labor} & = & \frac{\mathrm{GDP}}{\mathrm{LabProd}}\\
\lambda & = & \frac{\mathrm{Labor}}{\mathrm{Population}}\\
\end{eqnarray*}

Notice that Minsky outputs a Greek $\lambda$ in the equation. You
can input such characters directly, if your keyboard supports them
as unicode characters, however you can also use a subset of the LaTeX
language to give your variables more mathematial names.

With the employment rate defined, we are now ready to define a ``Phillips
Curve'' relationship between the level of employment and the {\em\textbf{rate
of change} of wages. There was far more to Phillips than this (he
actually tried to introduce economists to system dynamics back in
the 1950s), and far more to his employment-wage change relation too,
and he insisted that the relationship was nonlinear (as in Goodwin's
figure above). But again for simplicity we'll define a linear relationship
between employment and the rate of change of wages.}

Here we need to manipulate the basic linear equation that Goodwin
used:

\[
\frac{1}{w}\frac{d}{dt}w=-\gamma+\rho\cdot\lambda
\]

Firstly multiply both sides by $w$:

\[
\frac{d}{dt}w=w\cdot(-\gamma+\rho\cdot\lambda)
\]

Then integrate both sides (because integration is a numerically much
more stable process than differentiation, all system dynamics programs
use integration rather than differentiation):

\[
w=w_{0}+\int w\cdot(-\gamma+\rho\cdot\lambda)
\]

In English, this says that the wage now is the initial wage plus the
integral of the wage multiplied by its rate of change function. That's
what we now need to add to the Canvas, and the first step is to spell
out the wage change function itself. Firstly, since we're using a
linear wage response function, the rate of employment has to be referenced
to a rate of employment at which the rate of changes is zero. I suggest
using Milton Friedman's concept of a ``Non-Accelerating-Inflation-Rate-of-Unemployment'',
or NAIRU. We need to define this constant, subtract it from 1, and
subtract the result from the actual employment rate $\lambda$. To
enter 1, click on \buttonIcon{const.eps}, define a constant and
give it a value of 1. Then define another variable NAIRU, and give
it a value of 0.05 (5\% unemployment). Select ``parameter'' as the
variable type. Subtract this from 1 and subtract the result from $\lambda$.
You should have the following:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{images/NewItem108} 
\par\end{center}

Now we need to multiply this gap between the actual employment rate
and the ``NAIRE'' rate by a parameter that represents the response
of wages to this gap. Let's call this parameter \textbf{\em Emp\_\{Response\}}
(remember to include the underscore and the braces). Define the parameter,
give it a value of 10, and multiply ($\lambda$ minus NAIRE) by it:
\begin{center}
\resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{\includegraphics{images/NewItem109}} 
\par\end{center}

Now we are ready to add a crucial component of a dynamic model: the
integral block, which takes a flow as its input and has the integral
of that flow as the output. The wage rate \textbf{\em w} is such
a variable, and we define it by clicking on the \buttonIcon{int.eps}
symbol in the Icon Palette (or by choosing Operations/Integrate from
the {\em Insert} menu). This then attaches the following block
to the cursor:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{images/NewItem39} 
\par\end{center}

Now we need to rename this from the default name of ``int1'' to
``{\em\textbf{w}'' for the wage rate. Either right click or double-click
on ``int1'' and this will bring up the edit window . Rename it to
``w'' and give it a value of 1:}
\begin{center}
\scalebox{0.5}{\htmladdimg{NewItem93.png}} 
\par\end{center}

To compete the integral equation, we need to multiply the linear employment
response function by the current wage before we integrate it (see
the last equation above). There are two ways to do this. First, place
a multiply block between the wage change function and the integral
block, wire the function up to one input on the multiply block, and
then either:
\begin{itemize}
\item wire the output of the \textbf{\em w} block back to the other input
on multiply block; or 
\item Right-click on \textbf{\em w}, choose ``Copy Var'', place that
copy before the multiply block, and wire it up. 
\end{itemize}
The first method gives you this initial result:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{images/NewItem110} 
\par\end{center}

That looks messy, but notice the blue dot on the wire? Click and drag
on that and you will turn the straight line connector into a curve:
\begin{center}
\resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{\includegraphics{images/NewItem111}} 
\par\end{center}

The second approach, which I personally prefer (it's neater, and it
precisely emulates the integral equation), yields this result:
\begin{center}
\resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{\includegraphics{images/NewItem112}} 
\par\end{center}

From this point on the model develops easily---``like money for
old rope'', as one of my maths lecturers used to say. Firstly if
we multiply the wage rate \textbf{\em w} by \textbf{\em Labor} we
get the {\em\textbf{Wage Bill}. To do this, firstly create the
variable Wage Bill, and put it well below where $w$ currently is
on your diagram:}
\begin{center}
\resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{\includegraphics{images/NewItem113}} 
\par\end{center}

Now right-click on \textbf{\em WageBill} and choose ``Flip''. This
rotates the block through 180 degrees (any arbitrary rotation can
be applied from the variable definition window itself). Now right-click
on \textbf{\em Labor}, which you've already defined some time ago,
and choose ``Copy''. Place the copy of \textbf{\em Labor} to the
right of \textbf{\em WageBill}:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{images/NewItem98} 
\par\end{center}

Now insert a multiply block before \textbf{\em WageBill}, and wire
\textbf{\em w} and \textbf{\em Labor} up to it. Curve the wire from
$w$ using the blue dots (you can do this multiple times to create
a very curved path: each time you create a curve, another 2 curve
points are added that you can also manipulate, as I have done below:
\begin{center}
\resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{\includegraphics{images/NewItem114}} 
\par\end{center}

The next step is to subtract the \textbf{\em WageBill} from \textbf{\em
GDP} to define \textbf{\em Profits}. Take a copy of \textbf{\em
GDP}, insert it above \textbf{\em WageBill}, insert a subtract block,
and wire it up to define the variable \textbf{\em Profits}:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{images/NewItem100} 
\par\end{center}

In the simple Goodwin model, all Profits are invested, and investment
of course is the rate of change of the capital stock Capital. Create
a variable called Investment, wire this up to Profits, and then create
a new integral variable {\em Capital} using the \buttonIcon{int.eps}
icon. Right-click or double-click on it to rename {\em int2} to
{\em Capital}, and give it an initial value of 300:
\begin{center}
\scalebox{0.5}{\htmladdimg{NewItem102.png}} 
\par\end{center}

Wire this up to Investment:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{images/NewItem104} 
\par\end{center}

Now there's only one step left to complete the model: define a parameter
CapOutputRatio and give it a value of 3:
\begin{center}
\scalebox{0.5}{\htmladdimg{NewItem103.png}} 
\par\end{center}

Divide Capital by this, and wire the result up to the input on GDP.
You have now built your first dynamic model in Minsky:

Before you attempt to run it, do two things. Firstly from the {\em
Runge Kutta} menu item, change the Max Step Size to 0.01---to get
a smoother simulation.
\begin{center}
\scalebox{0.5}{\htmladdimg{NewItem107.png}} 
\par\end{center}

Secondly, add some graphs by clicking on the \smhtmladdimg{plot.png}
icon, placing the graph in the middle of the flowchart, and wiring
up $\lambda$ and $w$ to two of the four inputs on the left hand
side. You will now see that, rather than reaching equilibrium, the
model cycles constantly:
\begin{center}
\resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{\includegraphics{images/NewItem116}} 
\par\end{center}

If you click on the equations tab, you will see that you have defined
the following system of equations:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathrm{GDP} & = & \frac{\mathrm{Capital}}{\mathrm{CapOutRatio}}\\
\mathrm{Investment} & = & \mathrm{Profits}\\
\mathrm{Labor} & = & \frac{\mathrm{GDP}}{\mathrm{LabProd}}\\
\mathrm{Profits} & = & \mathrm{GDP}-\mathrm{WageBill}\\
\mathrm{WageBill} & = & w\times\mathrm{Labor}\\
\lambda & = & \frac{\mathrm{Labor}}{\mathrm{Population}}\\
\omega & = & \frac{\mathrm{WageBill}}{\mathrm{GDP}}\\
\frac{dw}{dt} & = & \mathrm{Emp}_{\mathrm{Response}}\times(\lambda-(1-\mathrm{NAIRU})\times w\\
\frac{d\mathrm{Capital}}{dt} & = & \mathrm{Investment}\\
\end{eqnarray*}

At this level of complexity, the equation form---if you're accustomed
to working in equations---is as accessible as the block diagram model
from which it was generated. But at much higher levels of complexity,
the block diagram is far easier to understand since it displays the
causal links in the model clearly, and can be structured in sub-groups
that focus on particular parts of the system.

\section{Basic Banking model}

\label{tut:basicBankModel}

If you haven't yet read the section on \htmlref{Creating a Banking
Model}{creatingBankingModel}, do so now. This tutorial starts from
the skeleton of the ``Loanable Funds'' model built in that section,
and using \htmlref{time constants}{time-constants} to specify
how quickly lending occurs.

\subsection{Loanable Funds}

Our model begins with the single operation of Patient lending to Impatient
at a rate that, if kept constant at its initial level of of \$10 per
annum, would empty the Patient account in 10 years. Because the rate
of outflow declines as the Patient account declines, the money in
the account decays towards zero but never quite reaches it.

%\begin{center}
%\begin{tabular}{|c|cccc|}
%\hline
%Flows $\downarrow$ / Stock Variables $\rightarrow$&\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{$Reserves$}&\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{$Patient$}&\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{$Impatient$}&\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{$Safe$}\\\cline{2-5}&\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{asset}&\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{liability}&\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{equity}\\\hline
%Initial Conditions&$120$&$100$&$0$&$20$\\
%Patient lends to Impatient&&$-Lend$&$Lend$&\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{\includegraphics{images/NewItem169.eps}}
%\end{center}

\begin{center}
\scalebox{.5}{\includegraphics{images/godleyTableWithAccounts5}} 
\par\end{center}

Many more actions need to be added to this model to complete it. For
a start, Impatient should be paying interest to Patient on the amount
lent. Add an additional row to the Godley Table by clicking on the
`+' key next to ``Patient lends to Impatient'' to create a blank
row:

%\begin{center}
%\begin{tabular}{|c|cccc|}
%\hline
%Flows $\downarrow$ / Stock Variables $\rightarrow$&\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{$Reserves$}&\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{$Patient$}&\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{$Impatient$}&\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{$Safe$}\\\cline{2-5}&\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{asset}&\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{liability}&\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{equity}\\\hline
%Initial Conditions&$120$&$100$&$0$&$20$\\
%Patient lends to Impatient&&$-Lend$&$Lend$&\\
%&&&&\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{center}

\begin{center}
\scalebox{.5}{\includegraphics{images/godleyTableWithAccounts6}} 
\par\end{center}

Then label this flow ``Impatient pays interest'' and make the entry
``Interest'' into the cell for Patient on that row. Make the matching
entry ``-Interest'' in the cell for Impatient. The flow ``Interest''
now appears on the input side of the Godley Table on the Canvas:

%\begin{center}
%\begin{tabular}{|c|cccc|}
%\hline
%Flows $\downarrow$ / Stock Variables $\rightarrow$&\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{$Reserves$}&\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{$Patient$}&\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{$Impatient$}&\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{$Safe$}\\\cline{2-5}&\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{asset}&\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{liability}&\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{equity}\\\hline
%Initial Conditions&$120$&$100$&$0$&$20$\\
%Patient lends to Impatient&&$-Lend$&$Lend$&\\
%Impatient pays interest&&$Interest$&$-Interest$&\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{center}

\begin{center}
\scalebox{.5}{\includegraphics{images/godleyTableWithAccounts7}} 
\par\end{center}

Interest now has to be defined. It will be the amount in Impatient's
account (since this began at zero) multiplied by the rate of interest
charged by Patient:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{images/NewItem173} 
\par\end{center}

With that definition, the dynamics of the model change: rather than
the Patient account falling to zero and Impatient rising to 100, the
two accounts stabilize once the outflow of new loans by Patient equals
the inflow of interest payments by Impatient:
\begin{center}
\resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{\includegraphics{images/NewItem174}} 
\par\end{center}

Though it stabilizes, this is is still a very incomplete model: neither
Patient nor Impatient are doing anything with the money apart from
lending it and paying interest. I am now going to assume that Impatient
is borrowing the money in order to hire workers to work at a factory
and produce output for sale. So we now need another account called
Workers, and a payment from Impatient to Workers called Wage:

%{
%  \noindent

%\begin{tabular}{|c|ccccc|}

%Flows $\downarrow$ / Stock Variables $\rightarrow$&\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{$Reserves$}&\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{$Patient$}&\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{$Impatient$}&\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{$Workers$}&\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{$Safe$}\\\cline{2-6}&\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{asset}&\multicolumn{3}{|c|}{liability}&\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{equity}\\\hline

%Patient lends to Impatient&&$-Lend$&$Lend$&&\\
%Impatient pays interest&&$Interest$&$-Interest$&&\\
%Impatient pays Workers&&&$-Wage$&$Wage$&\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%}

\begin{center}
\scalebox{.5}{\includegraphics{images/godleyTableWithAccounts8}} 
\par\end{center}

In a more complex model, the Wage bill could be related to the current
rate times the number of workers in employment. In this simple model
I will regard the wage as a function of the amount of money in Impatient's
account turning over several times a year in the payment of wages.
Using a time constant, I will assume that the amount in Impatient's
account turns over 3 times a year paying wages, so that the time constant
$\tau_{T}$ is 1/3rd of a year:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{images/NewItem176} 
\par\end{center}

The dynamics of this incomplete model are very different again: very
little money turns up in the Impatient account, and all of the money
ends up in the Workers account. However economic activity also ceases
as both lending and the flow of wages falls towards zero:
\begin{center}
\resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{\includegraphics{images/NewItem177}} 
\par\end{center}

This is because wages are being paid to workers, but they are doing
nothing with it. So we need to include consumption by workers--and
by Patient as well. Here the reason time constants are useful may
be more obvious. The time constant for consumption by Workers is given
the very low value of 0.05---or 1/20th of a year---which indicates
that if their initial rate of consumption was maintained without any
wage income, they would reduce their bank balances to zero in 1/20th
of a year or about 2.5 weeks.
